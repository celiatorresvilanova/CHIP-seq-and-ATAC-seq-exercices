# TASK 5. Distal regulatory activity

## Task 1: Create a folder regulatory_elements inside epigenomics_uvic. This will be the folder where you store all your subsequent results.

sudo docker run -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD --rm -it dgarrimar/epigenomics_course # Run container 
cd epigenomics_uvic									   # Move to epigenomics_uvic folder
mkdir regulatory_elements								   # Create regulatory_elements folder in epigenomics_uvic folder

## Task 5.2: Distal regulatory regions are usually found to be flanked by both H3K27ac and H3K4me1. From your starting catalogue of open regions in each tissue, select those that overlap peaks of H3K27ac AND H3K4me1 in the corresponding tissue. You will get a list of candidate distal regulatory elements for each tissue. How many are they?

### Intersect the previous list obtained for the ATAC-seq experiment with the overlap peaks of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 by stomach and sigmoid colon tissue.

bedtools intersect -a ATAC-seq/analyses/peak.analyses/peaks.outside.gene.sigmoid_colon.txt -b regulatory_elements/H3K27ac/Bed/ENCFF872UHN.bed -u |\
  sort -u > regulatory_elements/intersections/intersect.H3K27.ATAC.sigmoid.colon.bed

#### Intersect the previous output with H3K4me1:

bedtools intersect -a regulatory_elements/intersections/intersect.H3K27.ATAC.sigmoid.colon.bed -b regulatory_elements/H3K4me1/Bed/ENCFF724ZOF.bed -u |\
  sort -u > regulatory_elements/intersections/intersect.H3K4me1.H3K27.ATAC.sigmoid.colon.bed

#### Intersect outside peaks from H3K37ac:

bedtools intersect -a ATAC-seq/analyses/peak.analyses/peaks.outside.gene.stomach.txt -b regulatory_elements/H3K27ac/Bed/ENCFF977LBD.bed -u |\

### ANSWER: I obtain 8022 candidate distal regulatory elements for stomach tissue, 14215 candidate distal regulatory elements for sigmoid colon tissue and 22237 candidate distal regulatory elements in total

## Task 5.3 Focus on regulatory elements that are located on chromosome 1 (hint: to parse a file based on the value of a specific column, have a look at what we did here), and generate a file regulatory.elements.starts.tsv that contains the name of the regulatory region (i.e. the name of the original ATAC-seq peak) and the start (5') coordinate of the region. 

### Check the position of chromosome 1 (Chromosome number is in column 1 while start position is in column 2)

head -1 regulatory_elements/intersections/intersect.H3K4me1.H3K27.ATAC.sigmoid.colon.bed | awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{for (i=1;i<=NF;i++){print $i, i}}'

head -1 regulatory_elements/intersections/intersect.H3K4me1.H3K27.ATAC.stomach.bed | awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{for (i=1;i<=NF;i++){print $i, i}}'

### Include chromosome number and chromosome position in tsv file

for tissue in sigmoid.colon; do
  awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}$1=="chr1"{print $1, $2}' regulatory_elements/intersections/intersect.H3K4me1.H3K27.ATAC.sigmoid.colon.bed > regulatory_elements/data/regulatory.elements.starts.sigmoid.colon.tsv
done

for tissue in stomach; do
  awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}$1=="chr1"{print $1, $2}' regulatory_elements/intersections/intersect.H3K4me1.H3K27.ATAC.stomach.bed > regulatory_elements/data/regulatory.elements.starts.stomach.tsv
done

## Task 5.4 Focus on protein-coding genes located on chromosome 1. From the BED file of gene body coordinates that you generated here, prepare a tab-separated file called gene.starts.tsv which will store the name of the gene in the first column, and the start coordinate of the gene on the second column (REMEMBER: for genes located on the minus strand, the start coordinate will be at the 3'). Use the command below as a starting point: For each peak we need to identify the colosest protein coding gene.

grep -w chr1 ATAC-seq/annotation/gencode.v24.gene.body.bed | awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"}{if ($6=="+"){start=$2} else {start=$3}; print $4, start}' > regulatory_elements/gene.starts.tsv

## Task 5.5 Download or copy this python script inside the epigenomics_uvic/bin folder. Have a look at the help page of this script to understand how it works:

wget bin https://public-docs.crg.es/rguigo/Data/bborsari/UVIC/epigenomics_course/get.distance.py 
nano get.distance.py				
python get.distance.py -h		# Have a look at the help page of the script to understand how it works
python get.distance.py --input regulatory_elements/gene.starts.tsv --start 980000

# I don't obtain this result, I decide to modify the script to obtain this result

cd bin
nano get.distance.py

## Task 5.6 For each regulatory element contained in the file regulatory.elements.starts.tsv, retrieve the closest gene and the distance to the closest gene using the python script you created above. Use the command below as a starting point:

for tissue in sigmoid_colon ; do
cat regulatory_elements/data/regulatory.elements.starts.sigmoid.colon.tsv | while read element start; do 
   python get.distance.py --input regulatory_elements/gene.starts.tsv --start $start
done > regulatory_elements/data/genes.distances.regulatory.elements.sigmoid.colon.tsv
done

for tissue in stomach ; do
cat regulatory_elements/data/regulatory.elements.starts.stomach.tsv | while read element start; do 
   python get.distance.py --input regulatory_elements/gene.starts.tsv --start $start
done > regulatory_elements/data/genes.distances.regulatory.elements.stomach.tsv
done

## Task 5.7 Use R to compute the mean and the median of the distances stored in regulatoryElements.genes.distances.tsv.

dist.sigmoid.colon <- read.delim("regulatory_elements/data/genes.distances.regulatory.elements.sigmoid.colon.tsv", header = FALSE)
mean(dist.sigmoid.colon[,3])
median(dist.sigmoid.colon3])

### ANSWER: The mean of the distance of genes in Sigmoid colon tissue is 73635.89 while the median is 35802

dist.stomach <- read.delim("regulatory_elements/data/genes.distances.regulatory.elements.stomach.tsv", header = FALSE)
mean(dist.stomach[,3])
median(dist.stomach[,3])

### ANSWER: The mean of the distance of genes in stomach tissue is 45227.05 while the median is 27735
